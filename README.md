# rawIdea-to-refinedidea
let him cook
----
----i think their are ideas that are their in their imagination they try it see what doesnt work and what works which is very important seeing why it doesnt 
work is important because now you know how you're starting to establish a clarity of basis you need to work on... which includes the anon bar vs dynamic island pill bar.
-----research is just seeing if an idea has been explored and refined and mended finely to reality or if it didnt work...
-----thats why when you have an idea its important to deal research along with your exploration without the research, (i explore first make my own thang)
-----so you can see if an idea worked around a specific basis...
------raw idea wait let him cook refined idea
-----whats more interesting is seeing the raw idea than the refined idea
